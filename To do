1. Solution Execution:


   - The solution provided did not run as expected due to SQL Server not being installed.
   - There was a specific requirement to implement in-memory storage, which was not addressed in your solution.



2. Get Actor Functionality:


   - The implementation of the get actor functionality was not optimal.
   - Your approach involved loading all actors into memory before applying filters, which could lead to performance issues with large datasets.
   - A more efficient approach would be to apply filters at the data source level to minimize memory usage and improve performance.



3. Rank Validation:


   - The solution lacked proper rank validation in the add and update operations.
   - Implementing validation for the rank field is crucial to maintain data integrity and prevent invalid entries.
